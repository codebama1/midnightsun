			<p class="fact">Zebras are several species of African equids (horse family)
				united by their distinctive black and white striped coats.
				Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual.
				They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large
				herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys,
				zebras have never been truly domesticated.</p>

			<p>Zebra is most attractive animal. My daughter loves seeing them
				and playing with them...Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population.
				Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins, and for meat.Recent research
				has shown that TU-103, a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in zebra feces,
				can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.</p>
